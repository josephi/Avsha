# AvshalomCode

This is a scripting language in hebrew that is destined to help kids to know how to code.
Currently supports conditions and functions.
It is still in the very beginning and there's still a lot more work to be done. 
On the projects tab you can view all open tasks, any help will be awesome.

## Syntex

Most of the syntex is JS oriented with a few exception:

 - Semicolons are required at the end of each expression.
 - The returned value of a function is the value of it's last expression
 - There are no statesments.... yet.

Since markup doens't work well with RTL content, code snippets will added on a future site.
